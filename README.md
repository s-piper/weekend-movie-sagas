## Description

_Duration: 1 Week_

This my second project was a culmination of my first week using Redux.  This is a single page application that stores your movie collection.  When loaded you'll be greeted with a list of your movies being pulled from the database.  Clicking on a movie will load that movies genres and a description of that movie. You are also able to add new movies by completing the add movie form.
